abstract = {Comprehensive discovery of structural variation ({SV}) from whole genome sequencing data requires multiple detection signals including read-pair, split-read, read-depth and prior knowledge. Owing to technical challenges, extant {SV} discovery algorithms either use one signal in isolation, or at best use two sequentially. We present {LUMPY}, a novel {SV} discovery framework that naturally integrates multiple {SV} signals jointly across multiple samples. We show that {LUMPY} yields improved sensitivity, especially when {SV} signal is reduced owing to either low coverage data or low intra-sample variant allele frequency. We also report a set of 4,564 validated breakpoints from the {NA12878} human genome. https://github.com/arq5x/lumpy-sv.}

abstract = {Biological invasions result in novel species interactions, which can have significant evolutionary impacts on both native and invading taxa. One evolutionary concern with invasions is hybridization among lineages that were previously isolated, but make secondary contact in their invaded range(s). Black rats, consisting of several morphologically very similar but genetically distinct taxa that collectively have invaded six continents, are arguably the most successful mammalian invaders on the planet. We used mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences, two nuclear gene sequences (Atp5a1 and {DHFR}) and nine microsatellite loci to examine the distribution of three invasive black rat lineages (Rattus tanezumi, Rattus rattus I and R. rattus {IV}) in the United States and Asia and to determine the extent of hybridization among these taxa. Our analyses revealed two mitochondrial lineages that have spread to multiple continents, including a previously undiscovered population of R. tanezumi in the south-eastern United States, whereas the third lineage (R. rattus {IV}) appears to be confined to Southeast Asia. Analyses of nuclear {DNA} (both sequences and microsatellites) suggested significant hybridization is occurring among R. tanezumi and R. rattus I in the United States and also suggest hybridization between R. tanezumi and R. rattus {IV} in Asia, although further sampling of the latter species pair in Asia is required. Furthermore, microsatellite analyses suggest unidirectional introgression from both R. rattus I and R. rattus {IV} into R. tanezumi. Within the United States, introgression appears to be occurring to such a pronounced extent that we were unable to detect any nuclear genetic signal for R. tanezumi, and a similar pattern was detected in Asia. \copyright 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.}

Despite the frequent use of {OA} and {EAA} approaches and their increasing attractiveness for detecting signatures of selection, their application to field-based empirical data have not been synthesized. Here, we review 66 empirical studies that use Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ({SNPs}) in {OA} and {EAA}. We report trends and biases across biological systems, sequencing methods, approaches, parameters, environmental variables and their influence on detecting signatures of selection. We found striking variability in both the use and reporting of environmental data and statistical parameters. For example, linkage disequilibrium among {SNPs} and numbers of unique {SNP} associations identified with {EAA} were rarely reported. The proportion of putatively adaptive {SNPs} detected varied widely among studies, and decreased with the number of {SNPs} analysed. We found that genomic sampling effort had a greater impact than biological sampling effort on the proportion of identified {SNPs} under selection. {OA} identified a higher proportion of outliers when more individuals were sampled, but this was not the case for {EAA}. To facilitate repeatability, interpretation and synthesis of studies detecting selection, we recommend that future studies consistently report geographical coordinates, environmental data, model parameters, linkage disequilibrium, and measures of genetic structure. Identifying standards for how {OA} and {EAA} studies are designed and reported will aid future transparency and comparability of {SNP}-based selection studies and help to progress landscape and evolutionary genomics. \copyright 2018 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.}

abstract = {Native to China and Mongolia, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) now enjoys a worldwide distribution. While black rats and the house mouse tracked the regional development of human agricultural settlements, brown rats did not appear in Europe until the 1500s, suggesting their range expansion was a response to relatively recent increases in global trade. We inferred the global phylogeography of brown rats using 32 k {SNPs}, and detected 13 evolutionary clusters within five expansion routes. One cluster arose following a southward expansion into Southeast Asia. Three additional clusters arose from two independent eastward expansions: one expansion from Russia to the Aleutian Archipelago, and a second to western North America. Westward expansion resulted in the colonization of Europe from which subsequent rapid colonization of Africa, the Americas and Australasia occurred, and multiple evolutionary clusters were detected. An astonishing degree of fine-grained clustering between and within sampling sites underscored the extent to which urban heterogeneity shaped genetic structure of commensal rodents. Surprisingly, few individuals were recent migrants, suggesting that recruitment into established populations is limited. Understanding the global population structure of R. norvegicus offers novel perspectives on the forces driving the spread of zoonotic disease, and aids in development of rat eradication programmes. \copyright 2016 The Author(s).}

abstract = {Human commensal species such as rodent pests are often widely distributed across cities and threaten both infrastructure and public health. Spatially explicit population genomic methods provide insights into movements for cryptic pests that drive evolutionary connectivity across multiple spatial scales. We examined spatial patterns of neutral genomewide variation in brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) across Manhattan, New York City ({NYC}), using 262 samples and 61,401 {SNPs} to understand (i) relatedness among nearby individuals and the extent of spatial genetic structure in a discrete urban landscape; (ii) the geographic origin of {NYC} rats, using a large, previously published data set of global rat genotypes; and (iii) heterogeneity in gene flow across the city, particularly deviations from isolation by distance. We found that rats separated by ≤200 m exhibit strong spatial autocorrelation (r = .3, p = .001) and the effects of localized genetic drift extend to a range of 1,400 m. Across Manhattan, rats exhibited a homogeneous population origin from rats that likely invaded from Great Britain. While traditional approaches identified a single evolutionary cluster with clinal structure across Manhattan, recently developed methods (e.g., {fineSTRUCTURE}, {sPCA}, {EEMS}) provided evidence of reduced dispersal across the island's less residential Midtown region resulting in fine-scale genetic structuring ({FST}  = 0.01) and two evolutionary clusters (Uptown and Downtown Manhattan). Thus, while some urban populations of human commensals may appear to be continuously distributed, landscape heterogeneity within cities can drive differences in habitat quality and dispersal, with implications for the spatial distribution of genomic variation, population management and the study of widely distributed pests. \copyright 2017 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.}

Here, we detail a self-exhausting form of {CRISPR}-based drive system comprising genetic elements arranged in a daisy chain such that each drives the next. "Daisy-drive" systems can locally duplicate any effect achievable by using an equivalent self-propagating drive system, but their capacity to spread is limited by the successive loss of nondriving elements from one end of the chain. Releasing daisy-drive organisms constituting a small fraction of the local wild population can drive a useful genetic element nearly to local fixation for a wide range of fitness parameters without self-propagating spread. We additionally report numerous highly active guide {RNA} sequences sharing minimal homology that may enable evolutionarily stable daisy drive as well as self-propagating {CRISPR}-based gene drive. Especially when combined with threshold dependence, daisy drives could simplify decision-making and promote ethical use by enabling local communities to decide whether, when, and how to alter local ecosystems.

The role of genomics in invasion science is increasingly recognised, and the growing availability of reference genomes for invasive species is paving the way for whole-genome resequencing studies in a wide range of systems. Here, we survey the literature to assess the application of whole-genome resequencing data in invasion biology. For some applications, such as the reconstruction of invasion routes in time and space, sequencing the whole genome of many individuals can increase the accuracy of existing methods. In other cases, population genomic approaches such as haplotype analysis can permit entirely new questions to be addressed and new technologies applied. To date whole-genome resequencing has only been used in a handful of invasive systems, but these studies have confirmed the importance of processes such as balancing selection and hybridization in allowing invasive species to reuse existing adaptations and rapidly overcome the challenges of a foreign ecosystem. The use of genomic data does not constitute a paradigm shift per se, but by leveraging new theory, tools, and technologies, population genomics can provide unprecedented insight into basic and applied aspects of invasion science. \copyright 2021 The Authors.

We investigated the population genetics of a contact zone between two highly divergent lineages of field voles (Microtus agrestis) in the Swiss Jura mountains. To shed light on the processes underlying introgression, we used maternally, paternally, and bi-parentally inherited markers. Though the two lineages maintained a strong genetic structure, we found some hybrids and evidence of gene flow. The extent of introgression varied with the mode of inheritance, being highest for {mtDNA} and absent for the Y chromosome. In addition, introgression was asymmetric, occurring only from the Northern to the Southern lineage. Both patterns seem parsimoniously explained by neutral processes linked to differences in effective sizes and sex-biased dispersal rates. The lineage with lower effective population size was also the more introgressed, and the mode-of-inheritance effect correlated with the male-biased dispersal rate of microtine rodents. We cannot exclude, however, that Haldane's effect contributed to the latter, as we found a marginally significant deficit in males (the heterogametic sex) among hybrids. We propose a possible demographic scenario to account for the patterns documented, and empirical extensions to further investigate this contact zone. \copyright 2011 The Authors.

Brown (Rattus norvegicus) and black rats (R. rattus) are among the most invasive animals on the planet, with eradication being the primary tool for established island populations. The need for increased research for defining eradication units and monitoring outcomes has been highlighted as a means to maximize success. Haida Gwaii is an archipelago \~100 km off the northern coast of British Columbia, Canada, that hosts globally significant breeding populations of seabirds that are at risk due to invasive rats. Here, we paired sampling of brown (n = 287) and black (n = 291) rats across the Haida Gwaii archipelago with genotyping by sequencing (10,770-27,686 {SNPs}) to investigate patterns of population connectivity and infer levels/direction of gene flow among invasive rat populations in Haida Gwaii. We reconstructed three regional clusters for both species (north, central and south), with proximate populations within regions being largely more related than those that were more distant, consistent with predictions from island biogeography theory. Population assignment of recently detected individuals post-eradication on Faraday, Murchison and the Bischof Islands revealed all were re-invaders from Lyell Island, rather than being on-island survivors. Based on these results, we identified six eradication units constituting single or clusters of islands that would limit the potential for reinvasion, some of which will need to be combined with biosecurity measures. Overall, our results highlight the importance of targeted research prior to conducting eradications and demonstrate a framework for applying population genomics for guiding invasive species management in island systems. \copyright 2019 The Authors.

abstract = {Two species of invasive rats (Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus) arrived in New Zealand with Europeans in the mid to late 18th and 19th century respectively. They rapidly spread across the main islands of New Zealand and its offshore islands, displacing the historically introduced R. exulans. Today both species are widespread although the distribution of the sub-dominant R. norvegicus is patchy. Tissue samples were obtained from 425 R. rattus and 130 R. norvegicus across the New Zealand archipelago and neighbouring islands. We sequenced a standard 545 base pair section of the mitochondrial D-loop in order to construct a modern phylogeography of the two species and to make inference on historical invasion pathways and spread across the country. We found limited diversity in R. norvegicus haplotypes, with two widespread haplotypes across New Zealand and its offshore islands most likely corresponding to two independent invasions, potentially with English and Chinese origins. In contrast we found widespread diversity in R. rattus haplotypes across New Zealand and its offshore islands, most likely corresponding to at least four independent invasions to the main North and South Islands, Great Barrier Island archipelago, and Stewart Island archipelago. The most common R. rattus haplogroup was found throughout New Zealand and many of its offshore islands, as well as neighbouring islands in the Tasman Sea, and has been documented elsewhere across the Pacific, but with European origins. We also found both geographic partitioning and secondary invasions of haplotypes within the main North and South Island. In addition to distinct haplogroups differing by over three base pairs, which exhibit geographical partitioning suggestive of independent invasion events, for both species we also found instances of single base-pair differences within localities, elevating haplotype diversity. The geographical distribution of pelage colour morphs also correlates with haplotype distribution, lending further support to the hypothesis and role of independent invasion events.}

Gene drive technology is one alternative to toxicants for rodent eradication. Gene drive methods of rodent eradication offer an alternative to killing that has the potential to be more species-specific, more humane, and more biologically safe for use around humans. Technologies in development aim to apply either natural meiotic drive or clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats to influence offspring development so that all offspring are phenotypically male, eventually creating a population that is not reproductively viable. Implementing this technology would involve releasing laboratory-developed engineered mice into wild populations. Some areas for further research include assessing the e...}

abstract = {Invasive species are increasingly affecting agriculture, food, fisheries, and forestry resources throughout the world. As a result of global trade, invasive species are often introduced into new environments where they become established and cause harm to human health, agriculture, and the environment. Prevention of new introductions is a high priority for addressing the harm caused by invasive species, but unfortunately efforts to prevent new introductions do not address the economic harm that is presently manifested where invasive species have already become established. Genetic biocontrol can be defined as the release of organisms with genetic methods designed to disrupt the reproduction of invasive populations. While these methods offer the potential to control or even eradicate invasive species, there is a need to ensure that genetic biocontrol methods can be deployed in a way that minimizes potential harm to the environment. This review provides an overview of the state of genetic biocontrol, focusing on several approaches that were the subject of presentations at the Genetic Biocontrol for Invasive Species Workshop in Tarragona, Spain, March 31st, 2019, a workshop sponsored by the {OECD}'s Co-operative Research Program on Biological Resource Management for Sustainable Agricultural Systems. The review considers four different approaches to genetic biocontrol for invasive species; sterile-release, {YY} Males, Trojan Female Technique, and gene drive. The different approaches will be compared with respect to the efficiency each affords as a genetic biocontrol tool, the practical utility and cost/benefits associated with implementation of the approach, and the regulatory considerations that will need to be addressed for each.

However, genome-wide {SNP}-based phylogenetic trees are rarely analyzed without any further information. Including the underlying {SNP} data together with further metadata on the respective samples in the exploration process can facilitate linking the genomic and phenotypic properties of the samples. {RESULTS}: We introduce Efficient {VIsual} analytics tool for Data {ENrichment} in phylogenetic {TreEs} (Evidente), a web-application that provides an interactive visual analysis interface for the simultaneous interrogation of phylogenetic relationships, genome-wide {SNP} data and metadata for samples of an organism. Besides visualizing the phylogenetic tree, Evidente classifies {SNPs} as supporting or non-supporting of the tree structures and shows the distribution of both types of {SNPs} among samples and clades of interest. Furthermore, additional metadata can be included in the visualization. Lastly, Evidente includes an enrichment analysis to identify over-represented genomic features encoded by {GO}-terms within the clades of the tree. We demonstrate the usability of Evidente with the data of the pathogens Treponema pallidum and Mycobacterium leprae. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Evidente is available at the {TueVis} visualization web server at https://evidente-tuevis.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/, it can also be run locally. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Advances online. \copyright The Author(s) 2022.

Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

In the common situation that individuals are sampled at several locations, we show how sample group information can be used to achieve better results when the amount of data is limited. New models are developed for the structure program, both for the cases of admixture and no admixture. These models work by modifying the prior distribution for each individual's population assignment. The new prior distributions allow the proportion of individuals assigned to a particular cluster to vary by location. The models are tested on simulated data, and illustrated using microsatellite data from the {CEPH} Human Genome Diversity Panel. We demonstrate that the new models allow structure to be detected at lower levels of divergence, or with less data, than the original structure models or principal components methods, and that they are not biased towards detecting structure when it is not present.

Here we investigate the independent and joint contribution of both mechanisms as drivers of invasiveness in the perennial sunflower Helianthus tuberosus. We show that invasive genotypes have multiple origins, and that invasive spread was facilitated by the repeated evolution of extreme values in a single trait, clonality. In line with genetic accommodation theory, we establish that this evolutionary transition occurred by refining a preexisting plastic response of clonality to water availability. Further, we demonstrate that under the non-drought conditions typically experienced by this plant in its introduced range, invasive spread is mediated by hybrid vigour and/or two major additive-effect loci, and that these mechanisms are complementary. Thus, in H. tuberosus, evolution of invasiveness was facilitated by phenotypic plasticity, and involved the use of multiple genetic solutions to achieve the same invasiveness trait.}

Invasion biology provides extraordinary opportunities for studying the mechanistic basis of contemporary evolution at the molecular level. Although the field of invasion genetics was established in ecology and evolution more than 50 years ago, there is still a limited understanding of how genomic level processes translate into invasive phenotypes across different taxa in response to complex environmental conditions. This is largely because the study of most invasive species is limited by information about complex genome level processes. We lack good reference genomes for most species. Rigorous studies to examine genomic processes are generally too costly. On the contrary, cancer studies are fortified with extensive resources for studying genome level dynamics and the interactions among genetic and non-genetic mechanisms. Extensive analysis of primary tumors and metastatic samples have revealed the importance of several genomic mechanisms including higher mutation rates, specific types of mutations, aneuploidy or whole genome doubling and non-genetic effects. Metastatic sites can be directly compared to primary tumor cell counterparts. At the same time, clonal dynamics shape the genomics and evolution of metastatic cancers. Clonal diversity varies by cancer type, and the tumors\textquoteright donor and recipient tissues. Still, the cancer research community has been unable to identify any common events that provide a universal predictor of \textquotedblleftmetastatic potential\textquotedblright which parallels findings in evolutionary ecology. Instead, invasion in cancer studies depends strongly on context, including order of events and clonal composition. The detailed studies of the behavior of a variety of human cancers promises to inform our understanding of genome level dynamics in the diversity of invasive species and provide novel insights for management.}

Factors such as migration, level of population differentiation, and unequal sampling were varied in the data sets to mirror a range of realistic research scenarios. {AMOVA} performed well under all scenarios with a modest quantity of markers while {STRUCTURE} required a greater number, especially when populations were closely related. The popular {\DeltaK} method of determining the number of genetically distinct groups worked well when sampling was balanced, but underestimated the true number of groups with unbalanced sampling.

Information on {DNA} haplotype divergence is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This analysis of molecular variance ({AMOVA}) produces estimates of variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as phi-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The method is flexible enough to accommodate several alternative input matrices, corresponding to different types of molecular data, as well as different types of evolutionary assumptions, without modifying the basic structure of the analysis. The significance of the variance components and phi-statistics is tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but inappropriate for molecular data. Application of {AMOVA} to human mitochondrial {DNA} haplotype data shows that population subdivisions are better resolved when some measure of molecular differences among haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At the intraspecific level, however, the additional information provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site change into nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify the inferred population genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies show that site sampling does not fundamentally affect the significance of the molecular variance components. The {AMOVA} treatment is easily extended in several different directions and it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the statistical analysis of molecular data.}

The different types of analyses offered by genodive include multiple statistics for estimating population differentiation (φ{ST} , {FST} , F'{ST} , {GST} , G'{ST} , G''{ST} , Dest , {RST} , \rho), analysis of molecular variance-based K-means clustering, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, hybrid index, population assignment, clone assignment, Mantel test, Spatial Autocorrelation, 23 ways of calculating genetic distances, and both principal components and principal coordinates analyses. A unique feature of genodive is that it can also open data sets with nongenetic variables, for example environmental data or geographical coordinates that can be included in the analysis. In addition, genodive makes it possible to run several external programs (lfmm, structure, instruct and vegan) directly from its own user interface, avoiding the need for data reformatting and use of the command line. genodive is available for computers running Mac {OS} X 10.7 or higher and can be downloaded freely from: http://www.patrickmeirmans.com/software. \copyright 2020 The Authors.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Structural variants ({SVs}) are critical contributors to genetic diversity and genomic disease. To predict the phenotypic impact of {SVs}, there is a need for better estimates of both the occurrence and frequency of {SVs}, preferably from large, ethnically diverse cohorts. Thus, the current standard approach requires the use of short paired-end reads, which remain challenging to detect, especially at the scale of hundreds to thousands of samples. {FINDINGS}: We present Parliament2, a consensus {SV} framework that leverages multiple best-in-class methods to identify high-quality {SVs} from short-read {DNA} sequence data at scale. Parliament2 incorporates pre-installed {SV} callers that are optimized for efficient execution in parallel to reduce the overall runtime and costs. We demonstrate the accuracy of Parliament2 when applied to data from {NovaSeq} and {HiSeq} X platforms with the Genome in a Bottle ({GIAB}) {SV} call set across all size classes. The reported quality score per {SV} is calibrated across different {SV} types and size classes. Parliament2 has the highest F1 score (74.27\%) measured across the independent gold standard from {GIAB}. We illustrate the compute performance by processing all 1000 Genomes samples (2,691 samples) in \textless 1 day on {GRCH38}. Parliament2 improves the runtime performance of individual methods and is open source (https://github.com/slzarate/parliament2), and a Docker image, as well as a {WDL} implementation, is available. {CONCLUSION}: Parliament2 provides both a highly accurate single-sample {SV} call set from short-read {DNA} sequence data and enables cost-efficient application over cloud or cluster environments, processing thousands of samples. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.

abstract = {An important assessment prior to genome assembly and related analyses is genome profiling, where the k-mer frequencies within raw sequencing reads are analyzed to estimate major genome characteristics such as size, heterozygosity, and repetitiveness. Here we introduce {GenomeScope} 2.0 (https://github.com/tbenavi1/genomescope2.0), which applies combinatorial theory to establish a detailed mathematical model of how k-mer frequencies are distributed in heterozygous and polyploid genomes. We describe and evaluate a practical implementation of the polyploid-aware mixture model that quickly and accurately infers genome properties across thousands of simulated and several real datasets spanning a broad range of complexity. We also present a method called Smudgeplot (https://github.com/{KamilSJaron}/smudgeplot) to visualize and estimate the ploidy and genome structure of a genome by analyzing heterozygous k-mer pairs. We successfully apply the approach to systems of known variable ploidy levels in the Meloidogyne genus and the extreme case of octoploid Fragaria × ananassa.}

abstract = {The accelerating pace of genome sequencing throughout the tree of life is driving the need for improved unsupervised annotation of genome components such as transposable elements ({TEs}). Because the types and sequences of {TEs} are highly variable across species, automated {TE} discovery and annotation are challenging and time-consuming tasks. A critical first step is the de novo identification and accurate compilation of sequence models representing all of the unique {TE} families dispersed in the genome. Here we introduce {RepeatModeler2}, a pipeline that greatly facilitates this process. This program brings substantial improvements over the original version of {RepeatModeler}, one of the most widely used tools for {TE} discovery. In particular, this version incorporates a module for structural discovery of complete long terminal repeat ({LTR}) retroelements, which are widespread in eukaryotic genomes but recalcitrant to automated identification because of their size and sequence complexity. We benchmarked {RepeatModeler2} on three model species with diverse {TE} landscapes and high-quality, manually curated {TE} libraries: Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Danio rerio (zebrafish), and Oryza sativa (rice). In these three species, {RepeatModeler2} identified approximately 3 times more consensus sequences matching with \textgreater95\% sequence identity and sequence coverage to the manually curated sequences than the original {RepeatModeler}. As expected, the greatest improvement is for {LTR} retroelements. Thus, {RepeatModeler2} represents a valuable addition to the genome annotation toolkit that will enhance the identification and study of {TEs} in eukaryotic genome sequences. {RepeatModeler2} is available as source code or a containerized package under an open license (https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/{RepeatModeler}, http://www.repeatmasker.org/{RepeatModeler}/).}

abstract = {Formed in late 1999, the Rat Genome Database ({RGD}, https://rgd.mcw.edu) will be 20 in 2020, the Year of the Rat. Because the laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus, has been used as a model for complex human diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurological disorders and arthritis, among others, for \textgreater150 years, {RGD} has always been disease-focused and committed to providing data and tools for researchers doing comparative genomics and translational studies. At its inception, before the sequencing of the rat genome, {RGD} started with only a few data types localized on genetic and radiation hybrid ({RH}) maps and offered only a few tools for querying and consolidating that data. Since that time, {RGD} has expanded to include a wealth of structured and standardized genetic, genomic, phenotypic, and disease-related data for eight species, and a suite of innovative tools for querying, analyzing and visualizing this data. This article provides an overview of recent substantial additions and improvements to {RGD}'s data and tools that can assist researchers in finding and utilizing the data they need, whether their goal is to develop new precision models of disease or to more fully explore emerging details within a system or across multiple systems. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

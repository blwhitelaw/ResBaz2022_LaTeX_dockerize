}

\newglossaryentry{bdiversity}{
  name={$\beta$ diversity},
  description={
    ``generally defined as variation in the identities of species among sites, provides a direct link between biodiversity at local scales ($\alpha$ diversity) and the broader regional species pool ($\gamma$ diversity)'' \citep{AndCri2011}.

\newglossaryentry{allelicDifferentiation}{
  name={allelic differentiation},

    %equivalent numbers of equally abundant OTUs
